Yes, there is an alternate approach to solve this problem. Instead of using a recursive function, we can use a stack to remove the digits. We can iterate through each digit in the string and compare it with the top element in the stack. If the current digit is smaller than the top element, we can remove the top element and continue this process until either the stack is empty or the current digit is greater than the top element. After iterating through all the digits, we can remove any remaining digits from the stack to ensure we have removed the required number of digits. Finally, we can join the elements in the stack and return the resulting string. This approach has a time complexity of O(|S|) and space complexity of O(|S|).
